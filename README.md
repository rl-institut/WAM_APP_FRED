# WAM_APP_FRED

The WAM_APP_FRED is developed as an open-source web-application which visualize data that was collected or created 
within the project open_FRED. All data sources which are used within this web-application are open-source. The goal is 
to create an easy assessable and platform-independent web-application that can be used via the 
internet (using a web-browser). The main functionality the web-application provides is to visualize data on a map 
or additionally as graph. The app provide options for the user to interact with the visualized data. The web-application 
also provides functionality to get the data in a non proprietary format (like .csv). By that an user is able to explore 
the data in order to get a better understanding about the data. 
To make the purpose of what is visualized on the map or as graph more oblivious the source data is divided into 
three main topics. These three topics are: Weather-Data, powerplant asset register and feedin-time-series. Each of these 
topics basically have there own source data. The data is provided within the open-energy-platform. Further explanation 
is given in the section source data. 

To achieve these requirements we use proven open-source technologies. We use django as Web-Framework. The base structure 
for this app is the Web Applications&Maps (WAM) project. 
WAM_APP_FRED is a Django App which is part of the [WAM project](https://github.com/rl-institut/WAM).

## Overview

The aim of this app is to display the content of the Open Energy Database of the
[Open Energy Platform (OEP)]((https://openenergy-platform.org/)) in an interactive way.

## First steps

### Prerequisite

- First, clone WAM core project
```
git clone https://github.com/rl-institut/WAM.git
```
- Then, complete the [setup of WAM](https://wam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) core project

### Installation 

1. Clone the WAM_FRED_APP repository into the main directory of the WAM core project:
    ````
    - <WAM core>
        |
         - <WAM_APP_FRED>
        |
         - ...
    ````

2. Make sure you have added WAM_APP_FRED to the list of applications in the environment variable `WAM_APPS` 
which was created during the [setup of WAM](https://wam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) core project.
You can check the value of `WAM_APPS` with the command
```
echo $WAM_APPS
```
which return value should contain at least `áº€AM_APP_FRED`.

3. The database used in this project is the [OEDB](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform) database which is a external database
 that is not managed by django. For this reason we use SQLAlchemy to access the data.
 This is set in the .config/config.cfg file of the WAM core project as follow :
 
 ```
 [DATABASES]
	[[DEFAULT]]
	    ENGINE = django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis
        USER = <username>
        PASSWORD = <password>
        HOST = oe2.iks.cs.ovgu.de
        PORT = 5432
        NAME = oedb
    [[OEP_LOCAL]]
        ENGINE = django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis
        NAME = oedb
        USER = <username>
        PASSWORD = <password>
        HOST = localhost
        PORT = 54321
    [[OEP]]
        ENGINE = postgresql+psycopg2
        USER = <username>
        PASSWORD = <password>
        HOST = oe2.iks.cs.ovgu.de
        PORT = 5432
        NAME = oedb
```
 
Enter your [OEP]((https://openenergy-platform.org/)) credentials instead of <username> and <password>.


4. Run the local django server from the main directory of the WAM core project 

```
python manage.py runserver
````

## Usage

Choose which type of data you would like to explore

### Explore weather data

The weather data from OEDB are available at a spatial resolution of 6 x 6 km with a time step of 15min.

First choose which weather data you would like to enquiry in the menu on the left.

Then, click on the map and a popup with the closest weather data point information will appear on the map.


### Explore wind turbines informations and timeseries
 
TDB

### Explore feedin time series data

The feedin time series data needs to be uploaded to the OEDB. Once this is finished it will be possible to present 
the data as graph within the WAM_APP_FRED. 

####Introducing the Open-Energy-Database

The database which is used as main data-source for all of the topics is the open-energy-database (OEDB). 
The OEDB is a postgreSQL database that was developed within the open_eGo project. 

###Introducing the Open-Energy-Platform

The OEDB is managed within the openenergy-platform (OEP). The OEP is the presentation layer for the OEDB. The OEP 
provides the Open-Energy Dialect (OED) which is a RestFULL API. Using the OED one can query the OEDB. The OEP provides 
the open-energy-dialect (OED) which is the main RestFull-API to query the OEDB. The data should be provided as JSON or 
GEOJSON. 

 - OED on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oedialect). 

In order to use the  OED one have to provide user credential. The credentials are represented by USER-NAME 
and TOKEN. One can get these credentials by signing-up to the OEP. 

- OEP can be found [here](https://openenergy-platform.org/)

### Access data from OEP
